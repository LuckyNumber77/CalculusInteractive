# Backend Data Files

This directory contains problem data for the Calculus Interactive Game.

## Files

- **problems.json** - The active problems file used by the game API. Currently contains hand-validated sample problems.
- **problems.sample.json** - A curated set of 15 calculus problems with verified answers. Ready for immediate use.
- **problems.full.json** - Auto-generated file containing 485+ problems extracted from the Whitman Calculus text. Generated by running `node scripts/parseCalculusJson.js`.

## Usage

By default, `problems.json` contains the sample problems for immediate use. To switch to the full set of extracted problems:

```bash
cp problems.full.json problems.json
```

**Note:** The full problem set contains exercises extracted from the textbook, but many answers are marked as "See solution in text". For production use, these should be reviewed and updated with explicit answers.

## Regenerating Problems

To regenerate the full problem set from the source calculus text:

```bash
# From the repository root
node scripts/parseCalculusJson.js
```

This will overwrite `problems.full.json` with freshly parsed problems from `calculus.json`.
